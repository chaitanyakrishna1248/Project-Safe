# Project-Safe
A simple project designed during pandemic where residents of my apartment are provided with a passcode with which they can unlock the door of the lift to go their floors. Only the residents of the lift possess the passcode. This prevents strangers or outsiders from entering the elevator to ensure protection of residents from virus.
